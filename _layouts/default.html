        <center><h3>Question: How is Trump portrayed in different news sources?</h3></center>
        To begin we split up popular news sites based on their overall political stance. The three different categories are:<br>
        <p></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Liberal</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><a href = "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/section/politics">Huffington Post</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/pages/politics/index.html">New York Times</a></li>
              <li><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics">ABC News</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/">The Washington Post</a></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Conservative</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="http://www.breitbart.com">Breitbart</a></li>
              <li><a href = "http://www.foxnews.com/politics.html">Fox News</a></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Neither</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><a href = "http://www.npr.org">NPR</a></li>
              <li><a href = "http://www.economist.com">The Economist</a></li>
              <li><a href = "https://www.wsj.com/news/politics">Wall Street Journal</a></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <div>
          <center><h3>Our Analysis</h3></center>
          <p>To answer our question, we web scraped the article titles from the 9 news sourcesâ€™ politics page and/or
          opinion page over the span of this quarter.
          Once we web scraped the titles into a text file, we filtered out the titles based on the following key words: </p>
            <p><em>whitehouse, trump, conway, sessions, pence, president, tillerson, devos, flynn, kushner, carson, department, preibus, bannon, spicer, and miller.</em></p>
         
          <p>Once the titles were filtered, we wanted to see whether the more conservative news outlets used more positive language in their titles about Donald Trump, whether the
          liberal news outlets used more negative language, and whether the news outlets that deem neither stance are more neutral. </p>
            <p>To do this, we needed to use two essential Python packages:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>NLTK</li>
            <li>TextBlob</li>
          </ul>
          Both of these packages can be used for natural language processing analysis.
          <p></p>
          To see how we created all of the graphs below for our analysis, check out our <a href="images/CODEBASE_FINAL.html">code</a>.
          <p></p>
          
          <p>We used TextBlob to find the overall polarity (how positive/negative the words used are) and subjective the titles are.
          We predicted that the liberal news sources would be subjective and negative, the conservative news sources be subjective and positive, and the others be neutral and not subjective.
          </p>
          
          <p>Our findings can be seen in the plots below.
            The first plot shows the polarity of the titles for each news source. </p>
          <img src="images/polarity.png">
          <p>The liberal news outlets have a wide range of values for polarity, where most of the article titles are
          neutral, but overall seem to have slightly more positive article titles than negative ones.
          The conservative news outlets also have many neutral titles, with slightly more positive article titles. This
          is especially true when we look at the boxplot for Breitbart, we can see that the majority of the boxplot
          range is positive.
          The outlets marked as other seem to be more negative than positive but they indeed have more neutral
          article titles.
          </p>
          <!--
          A more numerical approach to determining the polarity of each news source is provided in the image below.
          <img src="images/polar.png" style="width:50%"><br>
          In this dataframe, column 1 is the total, negative polarity level and column 2 is the total, positive polarity level.
          As said before, the liberal news sources should be more negative than positive which is what we see for Huffington Post and ABC News. The difference between the total polarity level for the two is
          relatively so small we can infer them to be almost neutral. We see a bigger difference in the total polarity levels for Washington Post and New York Times. This is not what we expected since there
          are more positive than negative terms in the titles relating to Trump. This can be due to many different reasons which we will discuss later.
          <br>
          We expected the conservative news outlets to be more positive than negative which is indeed what we see for both Fox News and Breitbart.<br>
          Lastly, we expected the remaining news sources to be fairly neutral which is what we see for all of them but NPR. NPR seems to be overall more positive.
          <br><br> -->
          <p>The next plot showcases the subjectivity of each news outlet.</p>
          <img src="images/subjectivity.png">
          <p>Each boxplot tells us how subjective the articles for each news source is, subjectivity is a number is on a
          scale of 0 to 1, where 0 is very objective and 1 is very subjective. From the graph, we see that none of
          the news outlets are very subjective. The least subjective news outlet is Wall Street Journal and the
          most subjective news outlets are Washington Post and Breitbart.
          This makes sense because The Washington Post is one of the more liberal news outlets (against Trump)
          and Breitbart is headed by a few who hold a position in office under Trump (supporters).
          </p>
          <br><br>
          <h3>Comparing All Titles from News Sources</h3>
          <p>Since there did not seem to be a big enough difference between the polarity and subjectivity of the titles for the different kinds of news sources, we wanted to check to see how similar the titles are from each other.
          We did this using the scikit-learn Python package. Our results are shown in the table below:
          <center><img src = "images/similartitles.png" style="width:75%"><br></center>
          Comparing the titles for liberal, conservative, and other news sources for the most similar titles, there are the most similarites within groups rather than between groups. Liberal news sources share the most similar titles with other liberal news sources. Conservative news sources also have the most similar titles to other conservative news sources.
          This may mean that the type of news that liberal news sources cover are very different from those of conservative news sources. Conservative news sources never share a similar article title with liberal news sources. As shown in the table, conservative news sources and liberal news also share similar titles to "other" news sources.
            This implies that "other" news sources cover some liberal and some conservative news. </p>

          <br><br>
          <h3>The Media's Ideology and Its Perception of Trump</h3>
          In this section we observe how the viewer base's ideology of different websites affect their reporting on Trump. In order to get ideology scores we webscraped the <a href="http://www.journalism.org/interactives/media-polarization/table/consume/">Pew Reports website</a>.
          We obtained the tables first and then had to split the tables using regular expressions.
          After creating the data frames we used Pew's scoring ideology scoring criterion: [-8.5 for extreme left, -4.5 for moderate left, 0 for neutral, 4.5 for moderate right, and 8.5 for extreme left.
          Since we did not have Pew's survey data we first summed the rows, creating a total percentage of people that trust the news source.
          These numbers will represent the amount of people who actually believe the news source.
          We then divided each indivual value from the summed row allowing us to see the percentage of the makeup of people who trust this source.
          We then multiplied these valus by their respective group in the data frame and then summed across to get that news paper's average viewer base.
          These values wil not necessarily be the same as Pew's actual scores due to Pew having ranges for each value between -10 and 10 and then scoring survey results accordingly.
          However; this data was not openly available and in our case we thought this would give us a rough estimate of Pew's actual scores. Next, we obtained the size of viewership of each news source by summing the original trust percentages.
          This gave us a value that would illustrate how many people have actually trust of the news source.
          We then used this value to represent the size of people who trust the website, and this variable is illustrated in the plots below as the size of the dot.<br>
          <center><img src = "images/b1.png" style="width:75%"><br></center>
          In this plot we look at Pew's Ideology Score versus how Trump is represented in the media. In the plot we see a slight trend in news corporations positive sentiment towards Trump and their viewership's ideology. The most obvious examples of this trend include the Economist and Breitbart.
          For this plot we transformed our sentiment variable by multiplying it by two and subtracting one in order to make positive sentiments positive and negate negative sentiments.
          Both on the opposite ends of political ideology, however they both seemingly represent their audiences view of Trump.
          In the next plot we take a look at a random sample of the webpages articles sentiments against a random sample of a newspapers regular title sentiment.
          <br>
          <center><img src = "images/b2.png" style="width:75%"><br></center>
          In the plot above we look at the distribution of the random sampled sentiment and each news organization's sentiment towards Trump.
          This plot illustrates how most of the News sites have a slight negative sentiment towards Trump's administration than they have on average.
          <br>
          <center><img src = "images/b3.png" style="width:75%"><br></center>
          In this plot we subtract the average sentiment of website articles from their sentiment of Trump. We see that some wesites like the Washington Post and ABC News do not different strongly on their typical title rhetoric when talking about the current Executive Administration.
          However, the Economist, New York Times and Huffingoton Post all have covered the Trump Administration with increased scrutiny.
          On the right side of the political spectrum, Breitbart has reported on Trump with increased positivity.
          Fox on the other hand has actually reported on the current administration with slightly increased Scrutiny.
